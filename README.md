# REACT SPINE CARD

huz-ui-spine has @editor/assets folder. It contains two [spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) 2d skeletons, powerup and raptor. Each skeleton has some animations like run, jump and etc.

Our target is to give new UX experience to users by using 2d skeletons and dom elements. So we wanted to create a spine card displaying all available animations for each skeleton. A spine card is able to play the animation a user selected. All extra features are welcome.

To use a 2d spine skeleton please check it [here](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes).

Good lucks!
